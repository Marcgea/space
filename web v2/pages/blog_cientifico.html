        Astronaut Jeanette Epps works in the BioFabrication Facility portable glovebag to print cardiac cell samples for the
        Redwire Cardiac Bioprinting Investigation.
        Biomedical research and space physics consumed the Expedition 71 crew’s science schedule aboard the International Space
        Station on Wednesday. The seven orbital residents also worked on spacesuits and cargo operations throughout their
        workday.
        
        Three NASA astronauts participated in eye checks giving doctors insights on microgravity’s effect on the human body.
        Flight Engineers Matthew Dominick, Mike Barratt, and Jeanette Epps took turns scanning each other’s eyes with the
        Ultrasound 2 device. Doctors on the ground monitored the scans in real-time viewing the crewmembers’ cornea, lens, and
        optic nerve. Afterward, Epps operated standard medical imaging hardware and viewed Dominick’s retina and optic nerve for
        the B Complex eye health investigation.
        
        Dominick and Barratt also worked throughout the day transferring cargo inside the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft.
        Additionally, Barratt installed new gear inside the Combustion Integrated Rack for a study to improve fire safety in
        space.</p>

        <p>3D Bioprinting and CubeSats Top Tuesday’s Science Schedule</p>
      </div>
      <div class="texto-blog" style="margin-top: 15px">
        <p>Advanced space biology and CubeSat work topped the research schedule aboard the International Space Station on Tuesday.
        The Expedition 71 crew also continued its cargo work and lab maintenance to keep the orbital outpost in tip-top shape.
        
        Scientists are taking advantage of the weightless environment to learn how to print 3D cardiac tissue samples. NASA
        Flight Engineers Tracy C. Dyson and Matthew Dominick took turns operating the BioFabrication Facility, swapping
        cassettes containing the bio-printed samples inside the device, then processing the samples for incubation. The
        tissue-engineering study that takes place inside the Columbus laboratory module may offer the ability to print food and
        medicines for future space crews. Results may also enable the bioprinting of replacement organs and tissues potentially
        alleviating the shortage of donor organs on Earth.
        
        NASA Flight Engineer Jeanette Epps was on her second day of installing a small satellite orbital deployer inside the
        Kibo laboratory module’s airlock. Three CubeSats are packed into the device and will soon be deployed into Earth orbit
        for a variety of communications and technology studies. Afterward, Epps partnered with Dyson and NASA astronaut Mike
        Barratt transferring cargo in and out of the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft.</p>

        <p>Station Orbits into Eclipse, Crew Works Research and Spacesuits</p>
      </div>
      <div class="texto-blog" style="margin-top: 15px">
        <p>The International Space Station soared into the Moon’s shadow during the solar eclipse on Monday afternoon. The
        Expedition 71 crew members had an opportunity to view the shadow at the end of their workday filled with cargo
        transfers, spacesuit maintenance, and microgravity research.
        
        The windows on the cupola, the orbital outpost’s “window to the world,” were open and NASA Flight Engineers Matthew
        Dominick and Jeanette Epps were inside photographing and videotaping the Moon’s shadow on Earth, or umbra, beneath them.
        They were orbiting 260 miles above southeastern Canada as the Moon’s umbra was moving from New York state into
        Newfoundland.
        
        The space station experienced a totality of about 90% during its flyover period. Views of the solar eclipse itself, the
        Moon orbiting directly between the sun and the Earth, were only accessible through a pair of windows in the space
        station’s Roscosmos segment which may not have been accessible due to cargo constraints.
        
        Before the eclipse activities began on Monday, Dominick worked on orbital plumbing, serviced a pair of science freezers
        and swapped cargo in and out of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. Dominick then joined NASA astronaut Mike Barratt
        inspecting spacesuit tethers and organizing spacewalking tools.</p>
